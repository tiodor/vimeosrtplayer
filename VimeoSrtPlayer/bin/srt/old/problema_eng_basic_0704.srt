1
00:06:52,80 --> 00:06:52,80
Well, I would begin with Darfur,

2
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,400
the annihilation

3
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:58,440
of populations

4
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,320
just because they have another religion

5
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:03,680
or are of another race.

6
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:06,520
And the world is not interested in them

7
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:08,960
because they

8
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:10,800
have no resources.

9
00:07:13,00 --> 00:07:13,00
No oil…

10
00:09:07,40 --> 00:09:07,40
Problems.

11
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:08,480
If you squeeze a newspaper,

12
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:10,880
it seems like it will bleed.

13
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,440
We are just born.

14
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:51,480
We're just born somewhere on planet Earth

15
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:54,440
and if we don’t want to stay there

16
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:56,600
we go somewhere else.

17
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:58,520
But then, when we go somewhere else,

18
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:00,640
we're discriminated against.

19
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:02,360
I arrived two days ago

20
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:03,960
and on the 11th I must leave again

21
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:06,560
because my visa lasts for only four days.

22
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:09,400
As a Colombian,

23
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,160
as a citizen of the world,

24
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,320
I have no right to enter this paradise,

25
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,120
the paradise of the First World,

26
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,160
except for four days.

27
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,160
The day that the law

28
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:48,600
has effectively realized the possibility

29
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,360
of granting this right without restriction to all people,

30
00:12:57,80 --> 00:12:57,80
on that day humanity will have done more

31
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,280
than pass over a boundary.

32
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:03,800
It will have attained a degree of evolution

33
00:13:07,40 --> 00:13:07,40
fully to be desired by all cultures and nations.

34
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:30,240
Everyone can gain human dignity for themselves.

35
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,160
Before this, though, one must leave behind

36
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:41,200
the self-imposed oppression

37
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:42,760
of politics, ideology, religion

38
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:45,400
and nationalistic narrow-mindedness.

39
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:50,800
I come…

40
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:53,680
I come from the jungle

41
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:56,600
where I lived for the most part of my life with tribes

42
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:02,680
and where

43
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,280
the question of freedom

44
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:09,680
is much more meaningful than it is here.

45
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:15,720
I have never known more free beings than them,

46
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:19,560
the indigenous people…

47
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:22,760
no, I never have.

48
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:29,280
I knew it

49
00:19:31,00 --> 00:19:31,00
from the moment that this murmur first began,

50
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:34,640
and this babble.

51
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:37,600
It sent a shiver down my spine

52
00:19:40,00 --> 00:19:40,00
and I realized that something will come of this,

53
00:19:42,00 --> 00:19:42,00
that it's helping.

54
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:43,840
I was reminded a little of 'Wings of Desire'…

55
00:19:48,00 --> 00:19:48,00
There are these angels hearing all these voices.

56
00:19:51,80 --> 00:19:51,80
There's this similar kind of murmur the whole time.

57
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:54,960
And then this murmur was here, only it was real.

58
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:57,960
All these people really were thinking aloud.

59
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:21,560
This question is a bit racist.

60
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,200
If all Chinese people want to have a car,

61
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:01,640
presuming that they would want to drive

62
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,280
the most powerful, the biggest and the fastest cars,

63
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:08,600
then the skies above us would darken.

64
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:21,360
What if all Chinese people want a car?

65
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:24,760
Then all German people

66
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:26,600
must be turned into automobile workers

67
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,240
to produce cars for the Chinese

68
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:31,480
until all the Germans are exhausted.

69
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:33,400
It's an impossible story.

70
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:27,880
The problem is not how many people want a car

71
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,120
but that the door to human desires

72
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:36,800
has been opened interminably.

73
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:40,280
How can we close the door again

74
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:43,680
after opening it to our infinite, possessive desires?

75
00:25:38,00 --> 00:25:38,00
I'm speaking…

76
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:39,800
I'm speaking so much

77
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,320
about all the problems.

78
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:44,840
I'm setting it all on fire!

79
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:30,920
There are enough coffee pots in the world.

80
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:33,480
There are enough gadgets surrounding us.

81
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,320
There are enough chairs!

82
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:37,960
Use one of the many hundreds that are already there

83
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:40,560
and then put your energy into developing

84
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:44,360
those things that really matter.

85
00:27:46,80 --> 00:27:46,80
All this forms part of a culture of prostitution.

86
00:27:51,80 --> 00:27:51,80
Our values have become prostituted

87
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:53,800
and humanity itself just a big prostitution machine.

88
00:28:59,600 --> 00:28:59,600
It's a model

89
00:29:01,80 --> 00:29:01,80
that is destroying us.

90
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,160
It's a model that is consuming us.

91
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,120
The expression 'Third World' is truly an arrogant claim.

92
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:01,440
It is not a Third World but it is also a world

93
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:04,600
that has developed in a different way

94
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:06,840
or that has stood back from development.

95
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,200
But it is not the Third World.

96
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:10,840
What then would the First World be?

97
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:40,680
They started first by taking the gold away!

98
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:43,440
But gold for indigenous people didn’t have the same value

99
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:46,880
as it did for capitalists.

100
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:05,760
Oh plundered Africa…

101
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:09,720
Africa… terrible Africa.

102
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:13,600
It's impossible to talk about Africa without feeling…

103
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,280
without feeling our hearts twinge.

104
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:42,520
We also have to understand

105
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:45,840
that all of the resources

106
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,280
are shared by all

107
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:51,320
and they are first of all for those in need.

108
00:32:55,40 --> 00:32:55,40
Real property is property by need.

109
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,160
It comes about through need.

110
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,200
When I need a glass of water, then it is mine

111
00:33:03,40 --> 00:33:03,40
by right of need.

112
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,200
Slavery was about the exploitation of raw materials.

113
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:44,920
Today it's about oil.

114
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:47,160
Today it's about diamonds.

115
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:48,720
Today it's about

116
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:49,960
all the minerals and primary resources.

117
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:52,240
The countries…

118
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:54,760
the Latin American countries

119
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:57,840
continue to suffer exploitation,

120
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:02,560
the exploitation of their resources.

121
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:12,640
Just like vampires.

122
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:14,720
They are vampires!

123
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,120
They use the energy,

124
00:38:18,00 --> 00:38:18,00
the strength and the lives of others

125
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:21,560
for their own economic prosperity.

126
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:48,600
'We are children of a world

127
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:50,840
that has enough for everyone.

128
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:52,960
But so many remain hungry

129
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:54,880
while so few are well fed.

130
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:56,960
One will eat, the other suffer.

131
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:58,960
This is how it's always been.

132
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:00,840
Other nations must be poor

133
00:39:03,80 --> 00:39:03,80
so that rich ones can be rich.'

134
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:11,640
Let me give you an example.

135
00:41:14,00 --> 00:41:14,00
In Iraq now

136
00:41:16,00 --> 00:41:16,00
my country Iraq,

137
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:18,920
most people cling to

138
00:41:23,80 --> 00:41:23,80
and trust

139
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:26,200
only their own people

140
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:30,680
or their neighbors or others from their city.

141
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:34,760
Before, we did not ask who a person was,

142
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:37,680
where they came from,

143
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:39,840
from which city,

144
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,120
from which tribe or family.

145
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:43,960
We would be friendly, that's all.

146
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:35,920
I believe that within each of us

147
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:39,480
there is a racist dictator.

148
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:43,240
I’m convinced of this.

149
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:45,720
Because to us the family is closer

150
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:48,320
than the clan,

151
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:50,880
the clan is closer than the tribe,

152
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:54,760
the tribe is closer than the nation,

153
00:42:59,320 --> 00:42:59,320
the nation is closer than humanity.

154
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:17,920
It is incomprehensible how, day after day,

155
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:21,360
the world powers can spend so much money

156
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:25,480
on death.

157
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:22,520
The most important step

158
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:24,880
that all the women of the world can take

159
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:28,280
is not to give their children away

160
00:48:32,00 --> 00:48:32,00
to be turned into soldiers,

161
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:34,240
to be turned into killers.

162
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:37,440
I come from a region

163
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:39,360
where we all started to hate each other

164
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:42,600
and to kill each other savagely

165
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:46,200
as if the others were no longer human.

166
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:44,400
This question

167
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:45,600
is extremely, extremely, extremely, extremely

168
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:48,600
extremely close to my heart as an Israeli.

169
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:52,320
I can only say that, the way I see it,

170
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:56,280
there's no peace in the Middle East

171
00:50:59,480 --> 00:50:59,480
because of the vanity of Israel.

172
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:14,960
The only peace now

173
00:51:19,00 --> 00:51:19,00
is false peace,

174
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:23,320
peace based upon lack of trust.

175
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:31,520
Well, I believe the main reason is

176
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:33,920
because of fanatics on both sides.

177
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:36,480
On both sides.

178
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:38,440
You can't ignore the fact

179
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:40,520
that we are deeply scarred as a people,

180
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:42,800
but instead of trying to heal ourselves

181
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:45,880
by recognizing that we simply must use compassion,

182
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:50,120
love and forgiveness,

183
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:54,320
and engage in dialogue eye to eye,

184
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:58,600
we keep hiding behind our so-called righteousness

185
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:01,880
but there is no such thing.

186
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:03,920
And we feel like we're allowed to do anything

187
00:52:06,40 --> 00:52:06,40
because of what was done to us.

188
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:20,120
At this very moment, you can see around me

189
01:02:23,80 --> 01:02:23,80
a circle that represents a global community

190
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:26,880
where, clearly, there is diversity.

191
01:02:29,00 --> 01:02:29,00
diversity of thought,

192
01:02:31,00 --> 01:02:31,00
diversity of ideas,

193
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:32,280
diversity of concepts.

194
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:34,240
Is anyone there listening to us?

195
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:37,200
At some other time?

196
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:39,520
It might be catapulted into the world

197
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:42,800
like a discus.

198
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:46,200
Super.

199
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:48,840
Yes? Sounds good? That's it? Beautiful

200
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:51,320
Beautiful.

201
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:06,920
Our friend the camera.

202
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:34,640
Solitude is courage.

203
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:36,760
Hermetics.

204
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:37,880
Total neutrality.

205
01:04:40,40 --> 01:04:40,40
To be

206
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:41,840
unsure of yourself

207
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:44,880
is courage.

208
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:05,360
You don't know that Chinese prison labor camps

209
01:06:09,00 --> 01:06:09,00
are similar to Soviet gulags

210
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:11,640
or German concentration camps.

211
01:06:14,80 --> 01:06:14,80
About 40 or 50 million people

212
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:16,480
have lost their lives there.

213
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:18,960
I was there for 19 years

214
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:21,760
before I made it to America.

215
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:25,240
I didn’t want to talk about this

216
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:28,200
but finally I have

217
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:31,440
because we have only one lifetime.

218
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:35,400
What would Argentina have been without the courage

219
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:37,800
of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo,

220
01:06:40,00 --> 01:06:40,00
who stood up to the dictatorships and terrorism

221
01:06:43,40 --> 01:06:43,40
of the Generals Videla, Massera and Agosti

222
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:46,400
who 'disappeared' thousands of people

223
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:49,160
by throwing them into the sea.

224
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:50,840
What would have become of us

225
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:52,800
without the lesson in courage

226
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:54,800
taught by these mothers

227
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:56,200
who stood before the Casa de Gobierno

228
01:06:58,00 --> 01:06:58,00
every Thursday

229
01:06:59,280 --> 01:06:59,280
with the portraits of their disappeared sons?

230
01:07:03,40 --> 01:07:03,40
Courage means to understand

231
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:05,360
that these powers are not invincible,

232
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:09,440
as is being demonstrated by people in the world

233
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:12,440
who, with courage and indignation,

234
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:15,800
have managed to expel

235
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:17,960
transnationals from their countries,

236
01:07:20,40 --> 01:07:20,40
have managed to overthrow and topple governments.

237
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:52,280
We should keep this in mind and it should make us

238
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:55,640
all the more radical and motivated

239
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:57,560
as we don't risk our lives,

240
01:07:59,840 --> 01:07:59,840
but just a little boredom sometimes,

241
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:02,800
a little ostracism,

242
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:04,800
a little of our well-being.

243
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:47,400
Quite simply, 

244
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:49,160
future generations will not be able to understand

245
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:52,920
our delirium of destruction.

246
01:12:39,40 --> 01:12:39,40
There won't be any state of emergency.

247
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:41,920
We have been for thousands of years

248
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:44,280
in a state of emergency.

249
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:46,960
We delude ourselves into thinking that

250
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:49,520
these problems are the creation of

251
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:52,160
our nation, government, religion or race,

252
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:55,720
but this is not so.

253
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:58,360
The problem lies within

254
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:00,680
each individual's consciousness.

255
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:30,360
It is by our own free choice,

256
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:35,440
by our own personal efforts,

257
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:37,840
that we will achieve balance with nature

258
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:41,560
and so become like all of nature.

259
01:17:44,40 --> 01:17:44,40
Then we will feel

260
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:45,640
the eternity, perfection and harmony

261
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:48,640
that is everywhere in nature

262
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:52,640
except within our own.

263
01:19:59,640 --> 01:19:59,640
Which God?

264
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:03,680
Which religion?

265
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:21,440
God is a way of defining

266
01:20:25,80 --> 01:20:25,80
certain archetypes,

267
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:27,960
certain expectations and

268
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:32,160
objectives.

269
01:20:43,40 --> 01:20:43,40
God doesn't exist.

270
01:21:27,80 --> 01:21:27,80
I am of Love.

271
01:21:29,00 --> 01:21:29,00
I am of the Universe.

272
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:30,840
I am God in Action.

273
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:33,360
There is no God.

274
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:36,320
God is a symbol

275
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:38,720
for something that we can't express in words

276
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:42,240
and that's also why there's no God's religion.

277
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:46,200
God, we have to imagine, is something

278
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:50,200
that is not only unknown to us

279
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:53,840
but is also beyond our knowledge,

280
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:56,640
that has no quality of being known.

281
01:21:59,960 --> 01:21:59,960
It's like when we ask the question,

282
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:03,600
what is the color of a circle?

283
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:07,280
Is it red, green or blue?

284
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:11,520
No, it's neither blue nor red nor green.

285
01:22:15,40 --> 01:22:15,40
It is also not colorless.

286
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:17,360
The question about the color of the circle is absurd

287
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:21,720
because a circle knows no color.

288
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:24,640
Many people are unwilling to see this.

289
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:26,920
They take a pen out of their pocket,

290
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:30,360
draw a circle on a piece of paper

291
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:32,560
and say, 'Look, this circle is blue.'

292
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:35,680
Yes, the circle drawn by them is blue

293
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:39,920
but the color comes from a pen

294
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:43,120
and not from the circle.

295
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:45,600
The color of the pen is the religion

296
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:49,440
with which we express the divinity,

297
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:52,520
but we cannot draw the circle ourselves.

298
01:22:56,00 --> 01:22:56,00
It is something that has nothing to do with colors

299
01:22:59,440 --> 01:22:59,440
and there are as many religions

300
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:01,360
as there are colors with which I can draw a circle.

301
01:24:44,80 --> 01:24:44,80
I didn't think we'd make it!

302
01:28:31,80 --> 01:28:31,80
I believe

303
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:34,200
in a measure of humility

304
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:38,960
and in a measure of humanity

305
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:43,680
and in an avowal of beauty

306
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:46,200
as an antidote to all the brutality

307
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:49,160
and cruelty of the world.

308
01:28:52,00 --> 01:28:52,00
I believe

309
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:54,120
that the sacred lives in nature,

310
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:56,720
not only in the supernatural

311
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:58,880
but also in the beauty of nature.

312
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:01,360
I believe

313
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:03,720
that human beings are metaphysical animals

314
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:06,240
and always will be because of their mortality.

315
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:08,680
The human is the only animal that knows it must die.

316
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:11,920
This is the source of the mystery,

317
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:14,240
of the unending mystery of human existence.
